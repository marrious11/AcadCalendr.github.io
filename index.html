    <p>The steps below will be describing my timeline of tasks for my internship period with the Ocaml community:</p>
    <ol>
      
      <li> <spa>Identify the main goals:</span> Start by identifying what I hope to achieve during my internship. This would be to understand well 
        the PPX ecosystem, learn about functional programming, improve your OCaml programming skills, or contribute to open-source projects.</li>
      <li> <span>Dividing the time:</span> Once I have identified my goals, I'll divide my internship period into smaller timeframes 
        (e.g. weeks[preferably] or months) and allocate specific tasks to each timeframe. </li>
      <li> <span>Seeking guidance:</span> Reach out to mentors or community members for guidance when necessary. This will help me 
        stay on track and make the most of my internship. </li>
      <li> <span>Evaluating progress:</span> Regularly evaluate my progress and adjust my timeline if necessary. This will help me 
        stay focused on my goals and ensure that I am are making the most of my time with the OCaml community. </li>
      <li> By following these steps, I can create a perfect timeline of tasks that will help me achieve my goals and maximize
        my internship experience with The OCaml community. </li>
    </ol>
